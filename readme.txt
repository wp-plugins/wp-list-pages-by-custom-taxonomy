Widget to lists posts of any active post-type, filtering by any term of any active custom taxonomy. display title, or thumb, date and excerpt too.

== Description ==

This plugin will provide a new widget in the Widgets Section, so you can easily add it in any widgetized area of your theme.

With this widget you will be able to *list pages or posts or any other post-type*, filtering them by *terms of categories, tags and any other active custom taxonomy*. You can add filtering by *Custom Meta Field* value, and decide how to order the list.
You can also choose to display only *Title*, or to add *Thumbnails*, *Excerpts* and *Date*!

Its scope is very similar to the default **Recent Posts widget**, but you'll have tons of options and you can use it for any post-type and taxonomy.

Now you can also set the max width of the thumbnail, and the excerpt length, so the listing can display nicely even on larger widgetized areas.

**"This is the last listing widget plugin you'll ever need to download"**

the main features of the widget are:

*   Decide how many entries to display
*   Choose which Post-Type you want to list
*   Choose which Taxonomy will be used as filter
*   Choose which Terms to narrow your list with (or choose "any" term of the selected taxonomy)
*   Select multiple terms at once 
*   Include or exclude children terms of the selected ones
*   Filter by Custom Meta Fields values (full list of comparison operators)
*   Automatically lists in dropdown selectors, all available post-types, taxonomies, terms, and meta fields! no need to find their slugs or ids!
*   Order by Date, Title, Comments, Meta Field, or Random
*   Order Ascendant or Descendant
*   Choose if display Thumbnails
*   Set Thumbnail max width	
*   Choose if display Excerpts
*   Set Excerpt lenght (in characters)
*   Choose if display Date
*   Exclude specific posts/pages from the listing
*   image placeholder if no-thumb is found
*   Choose to display results into a simple dropdown

Also, the plugin is structured to allow *easy overriding of the output template*. 
Just duplicate the file pbytax-template.php that you'll find within the plugin subfolder "templates", and put it in your theme folder.

the widget is built with a very little css styling, in order to adapt perfectly in any theme. though, if you want to style it up, all the html elements have been named with specific classes, to allow easy targetting in your css file.


if you'd like me to add a new feature to the widget, please let me know by writing a post in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-list-pages-by-custom-taxonomy) , and hopefully I will add it to the next version of *WP List Pages by Custom Taxonomy*.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have a specific need for my site, could you help me? =

Yes, I am a freelance web developer and for living I develop bespoke plugins and functionalities of any sort.
though:
if your request could be considered just an additional feature for this plugin, I will add it to my to-do list and see if it's possible to implement this feature in the future versions of "WP List Pages by Custom Taxonomy".
if it's something very specific to your site, I would probably suggest to hire me for a few hours, and I'll develop exactly what you need.
