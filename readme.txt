Widget that lists XX posts of any active post-type, filtering by any term of any active custom taxonomy, display title, or thumb and excerpt too.

== Description ==

This plugin will make a new widget available in the Widgets Section, so you could easily add it in any widgetized area of your theme.

With this widget you will be able to *list pages or posts or any other post-type*, filtering them by *terms of categories, tags and any other active custom taxonomy*.
you can also choose to display only title, or to add thumbnails and excerpts!

**"This is the last listing widget plugin you'll ever need to download"**

the main features of the widget are:

*   Decide how many entries to display
*   Choose which post-type you want to list
*   Choose which taxonomy will be used as filter
*   Choose which terms to narrow your list with (or choose "any" term of the selected taxonomy)
*   Select multiple terms at once 
*   Include or exclude children terms of the selected ones
*   Automatically lists in dropdown selectors, all available post-types, taxonomies and terms, no need to find their slugs or ids
*   Order by Date, Title or Random
*   Order Ascendant or Descendant
*   Choose to display thumbnails
*   Choose to display excerpts
*   Exclude specific posts/pages from the listing

Also, the plugin is structured to allow *easy overriding of the output template*. 
Just duplicate the file pbytax-template.php that you'll find within the plugin folder, and put it in your theme folder.

the widget is built with a very little css styling, in order to adapt perfectly in any theme. though, if you want to style it up, all the html elements have been named with specific classes, to allow easy targetting in your css file.


if you'd like me to add a new feature to the widget, please let me know by writing a post in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-list-pages-by-custom-taxonomy) , and hopefully I will add it to the next version of *WP List Pages by Custom Taxonomy*.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have a specific need for my site, could you help me? =

Yes, I am a freelance web developer and for living I develop bespoke plugins and functionalities of any sort.
though:
if your request could be considered just an additional feature for this plugin, I will add it to my to-do list and see if it's possible to implement this feature in the future versions of "WP Pages by Custom Tax".
if it's something very specific to your site, I would probably suggest to hire me for a few hours, and I'll develop exactly what you need.
